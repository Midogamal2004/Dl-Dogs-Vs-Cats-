🐶🐱 Dog vs. Cat Classification using Transfer Learning
📘 Overview

This project applies Transfer Learning to classify images of dogs and cats using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG16, ResNet50, or MobileNetV2.
By leveraging existing models trained on ImageNet, the project achieves high accuracy with minimal training time.
